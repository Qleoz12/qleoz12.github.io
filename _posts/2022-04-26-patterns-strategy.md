This is an example for implementation for Strategy pattern

## Concept
The Strategy Pattern, which lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm
(called a strategy), and select an algorithm at run time. An example for several filter on a farmer app 
to get apples base on criteria, you can see these criteria as different behaviors for the filter method. For more info, check strategy design pattern 
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)



the situation is when you must face several ways to filter the apples base on criteria like weight or color or both and also another ways wil be required

simple filter by color

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pattern-strategy_z2.png)
simple parametrized filter by color

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pattern-strategy_z3.png)
simple parametrized filter by weight

in the previous images you can see the easy way to resolve the problem , implicates to repeat the code less the bold text
it's looks fits, but it breaks the DRY (donâ€™t repeat yourself) principle of software engineering. 
So if you must mix the filters or opend the code for new filter unknow currently 

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pattern-strategy_z4.png)
this image show a bad implementation for conbine the filters of color and weight

perhaps, if you re-think the problem a decouple the behavior you requiered you can realize this strategy pattern applied to this situation

But it implies you must create a new class for each new requirement you have to add to the farmer app, but if it class is for single use
then you could use lambda expressions for simplify more the code and get more cleaner and less complexity on development
check the las lines on main class for see the new improvement.



**Note:** this is an example of Strategy patterns, it will be a series to implement all patterns in java / python / go
{: .notice--info}

in the next classes you can see the implementation for apply the builder pattern and how in the MainClass call all implemantation
for show usage, you can see the flexibility for use this structure in the problem for OOP with functional programming like lambdas functions

## abstraccions 

```java
interface ApplePredicate {
    boolean test(Apple a);
}
```

```java
static class AppleWeightPredicate implements ApplePredicate {

    @Override
    public boolean test(Apple apple) {
      return apple.getWeight() > 150;
    }
  }
```

```java
static class AppleColorPredicate implements ApplePredicate {

    @Override
    public boolean test(Apple apple) {
      return apple.getColor() == Color.GREEN;
    }
  }
```
```java
static class AppleRedAndHeavyPredicate implements ApplePredicate {

    @Override
    public boolean test(Apple apple) {
      return apple.getColor() == Color.RED && apple.getWeight() > 150;
    }
  }
```

## Usage
```java
public class MainClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	List<Apple> inventory = Arrays.asList(
        new Apple(80, Color.GREEN),
        new Apple(155, Color.GREEN),
        new Apple(120, Color.RED));

		// [Apple{color=GREEN, weight=80}, Apple{color=GREEN, weight=155}]
    List<Apple> greenApples2 = filter(inventory, new AppleColorPredicate());
    System.out.println(greenApples2);

    // [Apple{color=GREEN, weight=155}]
    List<Apple> heavyApples = filter(inventory, new AppleWeightPredicate());
    System.out.println(heavyApples);

    // []
    List<Apple> redAndHeavyApples = filter(inventory, new AppleRedAndHeavyPredicate());
    System.out.println(redAndHeavyApples);
	}

	//Update JAVA 8 lambda Expresions for once use symplifies set of clasess
	List<Apple> result =  filterApples(inventory, (Apple apple) -> RED.equals(apple.getColor()));

	List<Apple> result =  filterApples(inventory, (Apple apple) -> apple.getColor() == Color.RED && apple.getWeight() > 150;);
	
}
```
finally I add this picture to resume the idea of strategy pattern to conclude the topic
