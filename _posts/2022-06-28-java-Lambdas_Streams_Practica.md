## Concept

**lambda**: A lambda expression (also called an anonymous function)
is a function without a name identifier. For example,
(int x, int y) -> x + y is a lambda expression that takes
two integer args and returns their sum. Lambda expressions
can be conveniently passed as parameters or can be returned
from functions, and are the hallmark of functional languages.
Some object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk, Scala,
JavaScript, and Ruby supported lambda expressions from
the first release.


**streams**: are an update to the Java API(JDK 8) that let you manipulate
 collections of data in a declarative way (you express a query rather than
code an ad hoc implementation for it). For now you can think of them as 
fancy iterators over a collection of data. In addition, streams can be 
processed in parallel transparently, without you having to write any
multithreaded code!.


## MeetUp 
Today, I attend to a meetup from the great group [medellin-java](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/medellin-java/events/286393287/?comment_table_id=522354757&comment_table_name=event_comment) on meetups platform, in the talk to give,
 access to the repo for face this little exercises for practice and 
 understand how apply lambdas expression for get cleaner and readable
  code a lase remove a lot of verbose code, we have to carry when we 
  implement anonymous classes comparator, for filtering and behaviors 
  another context that until java JDK 7, you must create for get your 
  code working, java 8 updates with new statics methods and default 
  methods on interfaces, its allows currently get cleaner and short 
  useful codes, integrating OOP and functional programming and all in java world
